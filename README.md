## Predicting the Utilization of Mental Health Resources Among Struggling Young Adults

Mental health challenges are more relevant and researched in this day and age than ever before. It is important to study the socioeconomic and demographic predictors to prevent and help those who are being affected by these matters on a day-to-day basis. Despite reporting mental health challenges, barriers remain in accessing support and resources (whether it be outreach programs, mental health centers, government policies etc). We are honing in on young adults with reported mental health struggles with goals of using predictors to identify these individuals and creating highly actionable steps that will guide them to aid. 

## Among young adults in the U.S, specifically aged 18â€“25 who report mental health challenges - what demographic and socioeconomic factors predict whether they utilize professional mental health services? 

### Hypothesis: Access to Health Insurance, Geographical Location, and Income level will serve as predictors for Young Adults who utilize professional mental health services because these details help determine level of availability for these services.
### Prediction: Adults ages 18-25 with no coverage on health insurance and a low income level are less likely to invest in their mental health since treatment is seen as a luxury rather than a necessity.
